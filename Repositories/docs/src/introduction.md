# Introduction

Hydroper(c) Flex enables efficient software development and the use of the ActionScript and MXML languages in order to express logic, data, computation, algorithms, and layout.

The Flex software development kit includes a package manager that allows you to use third party libraries and initialize new projects through a simple command, as well as compile existing projects through simple commands.

Flex supports two application architectures:

- Client applications, which support graphical user interfaces as well as creative two dimensional display objects and several media functionalities.
- Server applications, which maintain system processes.
